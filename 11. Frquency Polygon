Similar to Histograms, Frequency polygons are used to plot continuous numerical data of interval/ratio scale.
Unlike Histograms that use rectangles to plot data, Frequency polygons use line segments.
A frequency polygon is created by joining the midpoints of the class intervals against the frequencies.

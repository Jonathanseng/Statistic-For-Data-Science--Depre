1. If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of two or more
events occurring together are equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

2. For example, in a set of cards of 4 colors, the probability of picking a red card is 1/4 = 0.25 and the probability of picking a green card is 1/4 = 0.25 .
The probability of picking a red AND green card is 1/4 * 1/4 = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 .
